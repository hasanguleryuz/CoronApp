# CoronApp
A program that provides information about the number of cases of corona virus by country.

Provides access to the case data of countries through the "Firebase" system. Data is taken instantly. Programming language is used as java.

Using the program, you can:
-You can sort by country name, number of cases and number of deaths.
-You can search in the country list.
-You can click on the country to see the case numbers of countries. Information is displayed with the alert dialog.

The program can:
-Updates world data automatically. It does this by examining all country data.

I designed an assistant application to make Firebase transactions easier. 
With this application, you can change the desired country data instantly, also reset the daily case numbers with a single click.
